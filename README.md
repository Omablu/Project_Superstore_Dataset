## Project Requirement ##
A business Problem was presented by the Manager at U.S Superstore;
We're entering a new business year, and based on the company's sales performance in the previous year, are there any specific 
segments, quarters, months, products, or countries to which we should pay more attention? We need these pointers to 
perform better and make informed decisions in the coming year?
## Project Requirements
You are to analyze the U.S Superstore Sales Data extensively
Come up with 6 business questions you intend to answer with that data
Clean, analyze and visualize your insights 
Include the following:
Your KPIs (maximum: 4)
Suitable header and subtitles for each visualization
A suitable slicer
## Solutions
Business Questions:
1. The best-performing Segment
2. Highest sales by shipping method
3. Region that generated the most sales
4. Top 10 best-performing states
5. Most profitable Category
6. Segment with the highest sales
   
First, I checked for any duplicates and eliminated them
Then I went on to draw a few insights from the dataset like

1. The segment with the highest and lowest profit and sale, the sum and average of sales and profit.

2. After that, I created a pivot table to analyze better.
