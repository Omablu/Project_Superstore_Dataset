We're entering a new business year, based on the company's sales performance in the previous year, are there any specific 
segments, quarter, months, products or countries where we should pay more attention to? We need these pointers to 
perform better and make informed decisions in the coming year?

## Solutions
First i checked for any duplicates and eliminated them
Then i went on to draw a few insight from the dataset like
1. The segment with the highest and lowest profit and sale, the sum and average of sales and profit.
